My research explores governance and policy through the lens of collaboration, networks, and spatial dynamics. Working at the intersection of Public Administration and Public Policy, I study intergovernmental collaboration, policy diffusion, and institutional design to understand how local governments respond to complex policy problems in urban and metropolitan settings. I also engage with broader questions around sustainability, energy transitions, environmental justice, and urban infrastructure.

Methodologically, I draw on econometric models, spatial statistics, network analysis, and text-based approaches to examine how local governments and other actors collaborate—and how these forms of cooperation spread across regions. These tools allow me to identify patterns in collaborative governance and to better understand the structural and relational factors that shape local responses to shared challenges.
