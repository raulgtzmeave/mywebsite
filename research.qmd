My research examines the factors that drive collaboration among local governments to address urban challenges and improve public service delivery. I focus on how network structures, spatial dynamics, and governance processes interact to shape policy outcomes, emphasizing the relational and institutional mechanisms that enable effective interlocal collaboration. Beyond these theoretical contributions, my work also addresses critical policy challenges in sustainability, energy transitions, environmental justice, and urban development.

My research combines econometric models, spatial statistical analysis, network modeling, quantitative text analysis, and other quantitative approaches to examine how local governments collaborate and how these collaborative efforts spread across regions. These methods help uncover patterns and mechanisms driving interlocal collaboration, offering insights into how governance systems can better respond to shared challenges
