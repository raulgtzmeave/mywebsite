    "text": "My research examines governance and policy through the lens of collaboration, networks, and spatial dynamics. Bridging Public Administration and Public Policy, I investigate intergovernmental collaboration, policy diffusion, and institutional frameworks to understand how local governments address complex policy challenges in urban and metropolitan contexts. My work also engages with critical issues in sustainability, energy transitions, environmental justice, and urban infrastructure, contributing to broader debates in both governance and policymaking.\nMy research combines econometric models, spatial statistical analysis, network modeling, quantitative text analysis, and other quantitative approaches to examine how local governments and other stakeholders collaborate and how these collaborative efforts spread across regions. These methods help uncover patterns and mechanisms driving collaborative governance, offering critical insights into how regions address complex policy challenges."
