My name is Raul Gutierrez Meave. I am a Ph.D. student of Public Administration at the Department of Public Policy, Management and Analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). With a previous Ph.D. in Public Policy at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics (CIDE), my research focuses broadly on urban governance, networks, and local policymaking.

I am also an affiliated student of the Networks and Governance Lab at UIC. If you're interested in learning more about the exciting projects we're working on, I encourage you to explore our lab's website.
