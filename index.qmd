My name is Raul Gutierrez Meave. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Administration at the Department of Public Policy, Management and Analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). With a previous Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics (CIDE), my research focuses broadly on local governance, collaboration networks, and policy diffusion.
